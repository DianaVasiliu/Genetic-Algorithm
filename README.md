# Genetic Algorithm

This genetic algorithm was made to calculate an approximation of the maximum value of a 
function, for which the coefficients are given as input.

The algorithm was created for didactic purposes. It can be upgraded to solve different 
problems, such as the [Knapsack 0/1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/0-1-knapsack-problem-dp-10/) 
problem.
